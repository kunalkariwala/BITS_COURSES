# Tetris
Tetris game implemented in C++ to **console**.

This is my first project at *OOP(Object oriented programming)*,

i worked with *polymorphism* and *abstract classes* for the first time.

## Instructions

#### Buttons

```a``` - right

```b``` - left

```c``` - rotate

```s``` - stop (JOKER)

```x``` - hard drop (SHAPES)

#### Score calculation

* Hard drop (shape) - distance x2
* Single line clear - 100
* Double line clear - 300
* Triple line clear (or more) - 500
* Single line clear with joker - 50
* Bomb explode - (-50)  each cube

*The rest of the buttons are listed in the MENU of the game.*
