The only thing that changed from the previous part (Passing Information from Lexer to Parser)  
is the parser which is in the file "parser.y"  
Compiling goes as follows:  
./Makefile // this will do everything for you   
./steemit input_file // running for "input_file"  
The example used in the article is inside of the current folder with name "example2.c"  
To run this example you do:  
./steemit example2.c  
I would suggest running this example, as it contains functions and other things  
that the previous parser/grammar couldn't recognize
